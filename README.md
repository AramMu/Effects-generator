# Effects-generator

This is early program, or rather framework, I created for generating various cellular effects and simulations, similar to Game of Life, Forest fire and so on.
I usually focused on making flame-like and lightning-like effects, and also implementations of algorithms such as Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), such that gradually connections between dots are made with lines.
The description of this program is not well done yet, please provide me feedback and suggestions for improving it!

# Getting started
TODO: here will put the necessary actions for getting compiled and to run, or maybe run in browser instead?

# Documentation/Wiki
TODO: put external links to algorithms and strategies used for implementation, and my own tricks too!
